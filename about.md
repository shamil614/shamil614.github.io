![Scott and his wife Brooke](/assets/images/scott_brooke_hazel.jpg){:width="200px" align="left" style="margin:10px"}My name is Scott Hamilton and I'm a man that loves to work hard and play hard. I'm a husband, a father, dog lover, programmer, and a BBQ enthusiast. 

Programming in Ruby and Elixir stimulate and challenge me to no end. It seems every day, every project, every feature has new lessons to learn. I suppose that's why I like cooking BBQ; much like programming it takes time, patience, and skill. 

Over the years I have grown in many ways, and learned many hard lessons. This blog will serve as a good outlet for me to hone my ideas, and hopefully help others that need the information I write about.
